# From _ to Functional Programming in Scala

Aims to help programmers who write unfunctional codes (imperative programming) experience smooth transition from imperative to functional programming by comparing codes with examples.

The examples are written in Scala, which is not purely funcational but a blend of object-oriented and functional programming concepts supporting the combination of styles makes it possible to extend in both imperative and functional. Each article introduces a concept drives us re-think a job can be done in a functional way.

Our team actively maintain and contribute to this project. If you are already an expereienced imperative approach programmer and willing new challenges, "From _ to Functional Programming in Scala" is definitely a getting started guide help you achieve the goal.

Keep Learning and Happy Coding!
